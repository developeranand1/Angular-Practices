<h4>What is takeUntil + Subject?</h4>
<p>This is an RxJS pattern that lets you unsubscribe automatically when a component is destroyed.</p>

<div>{{ data | json }}</div>
<h5>"To manage unsubscriptions safely, I often use the takeUntil pattern with a Subject. I define a destroy$ observable
    in the component, and I complete it in ngOnDestroy. Then I use pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$)) in my observable
    streams. This ensures subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when the component is destroyed, preventing memory
    leaks."</h5>

    <h6> Key Improvements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed Subscription: You donâ€™t need it since takeUntil handles the unsubscription.</li>
        <li>Bound data to the template: Now {{ "{{ data | json }}"}} will display API data directly.</li>
        <li>Implements OnInit and OnDestroy interfaces: This improves clarity and correctness.</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        "In this example, I used a Subject {{"void>"}} called destroy$ and the takeUntil operator to automatically unsubscribe from the HTTP observable when the component is destroyed. This avoids memory leaks without needing to store and manually unsubscribe from the Subscription."
