<H4>In Angular, pipes are a way to transform data directly within the template. They're commonly used to format data
    before it's displayed to the user, such as dates, numbers, currency, or even custom formats.</H4>

<div>
    {{today | date:'fullDate'}}
</div>

<div>
    {{"Anand" | uppercase}}
</div>

<div>
    {{ 'angular custom pipes' | TitleCasePipe }}
</div>
